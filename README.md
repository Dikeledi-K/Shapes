# Python Patterns and Unit Tests

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of Python functions designed to generate 15 different shapes and patterns, along with unit tests to verify their correctness. It is tailored for beginner and intermediate Python programmers to practice working with functions, loops, conditionals, and unit testing.

## Features

- **15 Shape/Pattern Functions**: Includes a variety of shapes such as triangles, diamonds, pyramids, and more.
- **Detailed Docstrings**: Each function is accompanied by a detailed docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier to understand and use.
- **Complete Unit Test Suite**: The `test_shapes.py` file contains a comprehensive set of unit tests that validate the output of all patterns, ensuring correctness and reliability.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it suitable for those new to programming.
